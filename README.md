# Sophie's Pre-work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is my very first beginner project for my FullStack coding bootcamp class through U of R! I created it to showcase what I've learned during my pre-work studies. Although it is a small and simple project with minimal functionality, creating it helped me understnad how HTML, CSS, and Javascript come together to create a webpage. It also helped me understand CLI and Github, and how both of those are used to save my work and collaborate on projects.

## Installation

## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic (HTML, CSS, Git, and Javscript). If you open the DevTools console, you can see the Javscript running. It will list the topics I learned from prework and choose one topic for you to study first.
